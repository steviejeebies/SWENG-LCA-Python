# Lowest Common Ancestor on Binary Search Tree (Python)
* All tests passing
* Code coverage 100%

This is my implementation for LCA on a BST, written in Python (using the PyCharm IDE). 

I chose Python as the language I would experiment with, as I have practically no experience with it but understood that its syntax is very easy to learn (which is definitely true). I chose PyCharm as my IDE because it is so similar to Intellij (which I am already using for Java), so there would be no learning curve getting used to the IDE when starting this project. I found it very easy to convert my Java code/algorithm to Python, and found writing tests for the Python code to be a lot more straightforward.
